<p =class "description">
<br>We are a group with a common goal: to succeed in all the projects we are assigned. Our group was truly tested during the previous T.L.E.
<br>poultry and sauce challenge, but through our mutual dedication and commitment, we were able to overcome it.
<br>Each member of our group brings unique strengths and perspectives to the table, which we use to communicate and coordinate effectively.
<br>Together, we are able to achieve more than we could alone. 

<br>Our group refers to the commitment and dedication of every individual.
<br>The willingness of each member of our group contribute their time, effort, and ideas.
<br>Our members are not just working together because they have to, but because they genuinely believe in what the group is striving for.
<br>They are willing to go the extra mile, not for personal gain, but for the success of the group.</br>
